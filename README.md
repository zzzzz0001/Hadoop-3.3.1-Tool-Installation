Easy executable bash files

To execute a bash file, download these bash files (extension named as .sh).
Navigate terminal to that location of the .sh files.
Now use this command

# chmod +x ./<put_the_sh_filename_with_extension_here_without_these_arrow_marks>

This above code would make sure that the .sh file becomes executable which you can then execute it by using

# ./<put_the_sh_filename_with_extension_here_without_these_arrow_marks>
