Easy executable bash files

To execute a bash file, download these bash files (extension named as .sh).
Navigate terminal to that location of the .sh files.
Now use this command

<h3> chmod +x ./put_the_sh_filename_with_extension_here </h3>

This above code would make sure that the .sh file becomes executable which you can then execute it by using

<h3> ./put_the_sh_filename_with_extension_here </h3>
